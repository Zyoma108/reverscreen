Usage

-   Start application and click Screenshot button to start a new snipping.

-   In full-screen mode, you can select an arbitrary region using left mouse
    button.

-   If you see a highlighted object (dashed red line) found by computer vision,
    press Ctrl button and the selection will be snapped to this rectangle.
    Release mouse button and you are done.

-   You can also repeat the same procedure in windowed mode. Here, you can also
    use Ctrl button to control how the selection is done and what would be
    cropped.

-   Use Colors mode as a standard color-picker tool. The colors here are
    represented in CSS hexadecimal form.
