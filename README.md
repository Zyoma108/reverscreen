Usage
-----

-   Start the application and click the Screenshot button to start a new
    snipping.

-   In full-screen mode, you can select an arbitrary area using left mouse
    button.

-   If you see a highlighted object (dashed red line) found by computer vision,
    press the Ctrl button and the selection will be snapped to this rectangle.
    Release the mouse button to finish the selection.

-   You can also do the same in windowed mode. Here, you can also use the Ctrl
    button to control how the selection is done and what should be cropped.

-   Use the Colors pane as a standard color-picker tool. The colors here are
    represented in the CSS hexadecimal form.

-   The resulted cropped image can then be Copied to the clipboard or can be
    Saved to a file.
