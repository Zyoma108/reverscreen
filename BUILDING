I used Qt Creator to configure and build the app on all the platforms. However, you can build it using just qmake.

# MAC and LINUX
You will need to install qt, libopencv and libopencv-dev dependencies in order to build the app.

# Windows
On Windows, I used mingw32 to build BOTH OpenCV 2.4 and the app.
The reason is that the standard Qt 5.7 distribution is built with mingw32 and for proper linking, all components shall be built wit the same compiler.
Note: you will need to modify reverscreen.pro file point to your OpenCV build location.
